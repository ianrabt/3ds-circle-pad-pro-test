# circle pad pro investigations

*This readme is more a scratch pad for investigating the Circle Pad Pro -- I
haven't gotten anything working; I've just done some research.*  If anyone finds
this repository and has information about communicating with the circle pad pro
over IR, please email me!

No one has written an easy to use library for the Circle Pad Pro for the o3DS,
as far as I can tell.  However, there has been some progress reverse engineering
it.  I am going to spend some time tinkering with this.

It uses a [user IR
service](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/IR_Services#IR_Service_.22ir:USER.22), with
a [partially reverse engineered
protocol](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Circle_Pad_Pro)

A thread on gbatemp.net has some information (particularly [this
post](https://gbatemp.net/threads/infra-red-resource-thread.399336/page-10#post-6068141)),
but the original author never got past establishing a connection.

No useful information can be found by searching the nintendo homebrew discord.
